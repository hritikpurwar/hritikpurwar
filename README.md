# 👋 Hey, I'm Hritik Purwar

I'm a software engineer who enjoys solving real-world problems by building clean, scalable, and maintainable systems. I spend a good chunk of my time thinking about architecture, design patterns, and how software can be made to age gracefully.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 👨‍💻 Currently at **Optum**, working on internal and external APIs, CI/CD automation, infrastructure (Helm, Kubernetes), and observability.
- 📊 Led several impactful projects including:
  - End to End delivery of feature saving $180k yearly
  - Replacing Jenkins pipelines with GitHub Actions to bring down infra costs saving around $24k yearly
  - Creating internal Helm charts to simplify and version app deployments.
  - End-to-end service integration and visualization in Grafana using Prometheus.
- 🌐 Occasionally full-stack — familiar with **Angular**, **ExpressJS**, and **MongoDB**.

## 🔍 What I Enjoy

- 🧩 **Tinkering**: You'll find me exploring about Linux internals, breaking and fixing Neovim configs, or honing my CLI skills.
- 🎯 **Software Architecture**: Deeply care about how systems are structured, how components interact, and how designs evolve under change.
- 🔄 **Flexibility**: I don't marry a tech stack — I’ve mostly worked with .NET, JS, Docker, Helm, and I'm equally comfortable learning something new.

## 🧪 Currently Exploring

- ⚙️ **Rust** – the promise of safety and performance is exciting; slowly working my way through the borrow checker.
- 🌱 **Golang** – enjoying the simplicity and concurrency model; looking forward to applying it to side projects.
- 🧠 **Better ways to think** – Zettelkasten-style knowledge management using Obsidian, Git, and a bit of Markdown magic.
